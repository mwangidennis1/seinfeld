The program implements a way of communicating as group chat where people can send each other messages using sockets in java

The program uses multithreading to maintain all socket connnections 

To run the program  start the server instance first at any open port in your machine i have used a generic 5000 which you can leave it as a default

Open other instances of client seperately  and you will be prompted to enter  usernames to help in identication of people sending mesages in the chat

to shutdown an instance of client ,the user should send \quit and socket connection will be closed and other clients will be informed

The program is still being extended with individual messaging and a GUI  in the design phase 

If you wish to contribute  in this  project in any manner  it will be highly appreciated
